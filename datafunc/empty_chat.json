If any single edit fails (e.g., its `old_string` is not found), the whole operation is rolled back, and the file remains unmodified.\n\n**Critical Considerations:**\n- You must first use the `read` tool to understand the file's contents.\n- Plan your sequence of edits carefully. An earlier edit might alter the text that a later edit is intended to match, which could cause the later edit to fail.",

If omitted, the file from the start to the end or a maximum of 1000 lines will be returned. - The output is formatted with line numbers for easy reference, which is crucial context for subsequent edit operations. **Best Practices:** - When investigating a task, it is often effective to read multiple potentially relevant files in a single turn to build a complete understanding of the context.",
